# Setup

## Installation

```shell
  npm install bigsby

  # or

  yarn install bigsby
```

If you plan to use request/response validation:

```shell
  npm install joi

  # or

  yarn install joi
```

## Configuration

Make sure your tsconfig.json contains

```json
{
  "experimentalDecorators": true,
  "emitDecoratorMetadata": true
}
```

Dependency Injection will trigger typescript's `strictPropertyInitialization` in classes if you use field injection.
You can use `!` to bypass this, and if you're using eslint you might want to consider turning off
`@typescript-eslint/no-non-null-assertion`.
