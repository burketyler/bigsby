# Setup

## Installation

```shell
  npm install bigsby

  # or

  yarn add bigsby
```

If you plan to use request/response validation:

```shell
  npm install joi

  # or

  yarn add joi
```

## Configuration

Make sure your tsconfig.json contains

```json
{
  "experimentalDecorators": true,
  "emitDecoratorMetadata": true
}
```

Dependency Injection will trigger typescript's `strictPropertyInitialization` in classes if you use field injection.
You can use `!` to bypass this, and if you're using eslint you might want to consider turning off
`@typescript-eslint/no-non-null-assertion`.

### Webpack

Bigsby and it's underlying dependencies have been tested and are compatible with [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
v5, so there's no need to add it as an [external](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/externals/) in your webpack
config. Including it in your bundled code will greatly reduce it's overall footprint, just make sure your config
includes resolving `.js` files.
