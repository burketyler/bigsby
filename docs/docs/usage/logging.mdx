# Logging

Log messages in Bigsby are produced in a structured JSON format. Noise is kept to a minimum by default, limited to the
incoming request path and outgoing response status code. Logging behaviour can be customized using configuration or
using an environment variable. By default, logging is enabled and set to the `info` log level.

## Levels

Supported log levels:

- `debug`: verbose debugging information.
- `info`: light incoming/outgoing message metadata.
- `warn`: notable events that won't result in the pre-mature termination of the request execution lifecycle, but should
be addressed.
- `error`: events that result in the pre-mature termination of the request execution lifecycle.

## Environment variable

Logging behaviour can be defined using the `BIGSBY_LOG` environment variable. Configuration set at this
level will override configurations provided to the Bigsby instance.

A comma separated string of instance names and log levels is parsed at runtime to determine behaviour (a Bigsby
instance can be given a name at the point of instantiation as a constructor argument).

```typescript
// "{instanceName}={logLevel},{instanceName}={logLevel}"
process.env.BIGSBY_LOG="bigsby=info,myapp=error";
```

A wildcard `*` can be specified to turn logging on at the `debug` level for all instances.

```typescript
process.env.BIGSBY_LOG="*";
```

:::info

The default instance name is `bigsby`, which increments to `bigsby(1)`, `bigsby(2)` etc. if multiple un-named
instances are created.

## Bigsby configuration

Logging config can be defined when creating a Bigsby instance, as per below.

```typescript
const bigsby = new Bigsby(
  {
    logging: {
      enabled: true,
      level: LogLevel.INFO,
    }
  }
);
```

### Logger override

It's possible to BYO logger by providing an object or class which implements the `BigsbyLogger` interface. If your chosen
logger doesn't fit this interface out of the box, it's recommended to write adapter function.

```typescript
const loggerAdapter: BigsbyLogger = {
  info: (msg: string, ...meta: any[]) => myLogger.info(msg), // <- transform inputs here to desired format
  // ... other methods
}


const bigsby = new Bigsby(
  {
    logging: {
      logger: loggerAdapter
    }
  }
);
```
