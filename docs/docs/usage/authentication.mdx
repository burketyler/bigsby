# Authentication

Authentication with Bigsby revolves around the concept of `authenticators` and `AuthSchemas`.

## Authenticators

An authenticator is an asynchronous method provided to Bigsby that's used to determine if a
request is authenticated and/or authorised to perform the requested action.

```typescript
async function apiKeyAuthenticator(ctx: RequestContext): Promise<void> {
  const apiKey = ctx.event.headers["X-Api-Key"];

  if (!apiKey) {
    // Results in 401
    throw new UnauthorizedError();
  } else if (!isValidApiKey(apiKey)) {
    // Results in 403
    throw new ForbiddenError();
  } else if (!isUserEnabled(apiKey)) {
    // 401 by default
    // Catch me in onAuthFail to return custom response
    throw new CustomError();
  } else {
    // For use later in lifecycle
    ctx.apiKey = apiKey;
  }
}
```

### Authorizing a request

If an authenticator function resolves, it's determined that the request is authorized
and that the caller has sufficient privileges to perform the action.

### Denying a request

If an authenticator function rejects, it's determined that the request is unauthorized or that the
caller doesn't have sufficient privileges to perform the action. You can define which scenario
is applicable by throwing the corresponding error type:

- `UnauthorizedError` will cause Bigsby to return a `401 Unauthorized` response.
- `ForbiddenErrror` will cause Bigsby to return a `403 Forbidden` response.

### Custom Errors

Any value can be thrown from an authenticator. By default, Bigsby will return a `401` if
the error type isn't recognized. This behaviour can be overridden by listening to the `onAuthFail`
[lifecycle](./lifecycle.mdx) hook and returning a custom `ApiResponse`.

### Session Information

Authenticators receive the Bigsby `RequestContext`, giving full access to the values required
to verify a request and the ability to store session metadata, user information, etc.
for consumption later in the request's [lifecycle](./lifecycle.mdx).

## Auth Scheme

Auth schemes are named authenticators that can be registered at the Bigsby instance level
via the `registerAuthScheme` method. The schemes can be consumed by any handler created with the
instance.

Provide the scheme name to the `@Authentication` decorator to attach it to the handler class.

```typescript
const bigsby = new Bigsby();

bigsby.registerAuthScheme({
  name: "ApiKeyAuth",
  authenticator: async ({ event }): Promise<void> => {
    if (!event.headers["X-Api-Key"]) {
      throw new UnauthorizedError();
    }
  },
});

@Api()
@Authentication("ApiKeyAuth")
class ArnyQuotesHandler implements ApiHandler {
  public async invoke(): Promise<string> {
    return getQuote();
  }
}

export default bigsby.createApiHandler(ArnyQuotesHandler);
```

## Inline Authenticator

An authenticator can be attached directly to a handler class using the `@Authentication` decorator.
Simply pass your authenticator method as an argument without needing to onRegister it as a scheme first.

```typescript
const bigsby = new Bigsby();

async function apiKeyAuthenticator({ event }): Promise<void> {
  if (!event.headers["X-Api-Key"]) {
    throw new UnauthorizedError();
  }
}

@Api()
@Authentication(apiKeyAuthenticator)
class ArnyQuotesHandler implements ApiHandler {
  public async invoke(): Promise<string> {
    return getQuote();
  }
}

export default bigsby.createApiHandler(ArnyQuotesHandler);
```

## Aliases

- `@Authentication` can be shortened to `@Auth`.
