# Plugins

Plugins are a way to package and share code used to bootstrap a Bigsby instance. A plugin is
registered using the `registerPlugin` method, which accepts a `BigsbyPluginRegistration`
object.

A plugin is composed of a `name` and an `onRegister` method. The `onRegister` method
accepts two arguments: the Bigsby instance it's being registered to, as well as any
options that were declared as part of the registration.

```typescript
const bigsby = new Bigsby();

async function addJwtAuthScheme(
  instance: BigsbyInstance,
  options: Record<string, unknown>
): Promise<void> {
  instance.registerAuthMethod({
    name: "jwt",
    authenticator: async ({ event }) => {
      return verifyJwt(event.headers.authorization, options.secret);
    },
  });
}

const myPlugin: BigsbyPlugin = {
  name: "my-plugin",
  onRegister: addJwtAuthScheme,
};

bigsby.registerPlugin({ plugin: myPlugin, options: { secret: "mySecretKey" } });
```

:::info

Plugins will execute in the order of their registration when your handler
initializes.
