# Dependency Injection

Bigsby uses [ts-injection](https://github.com/burketyler/ts-injection) under the hood to provide an
easy to use, intuitive and clean dependency injection interface. The main building blocks of DI in a
Bigsby app are the `InjectionContainer` and `Injectable` classes.

## InjectionContainer

An `InjectionContainer` is an encapsulated DI environment where Injectables can be stored and retrieved.
Each Bigsby instance is created with its own InjectionContainer and will have its own instances of
Injectable classes and objects.

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>
  <a
    href={"/bigsby/img/di-container-diagram.png"}
    target={"_blank"}
    style={{ width: "50%" }}
  >
    <img
      src={"/bigsby/img/di-container-diagram.png"}
      alt={"Dependency Injection Containers"}
    />
  </a>
</div>

## Injectable

The [@Injectable](https://burketyler.github.io/ts-injection/docs/usage#defining-an-injectable)
decorator lets the framework know that you intend for the class to be handled by the injection container.
Common use cases for injectable classes are re-usable components and service providers. Consider a
simplified version of handler class we created in the previous section [getting started](./getting-started).

```typescript
@Api()
class ArnyQuotesHandler implements ApiHandler {
  constructor(private readonly service: ArnyService) {}

  public async invoke(): Promise<string> {
    return this.service.getQuote();
  }
}
```

The class relies on a service provider to retrieve a famous quote by Arnold Schwarzenegger. We can enable
automatic injection of the `ArnyService` class by defining it as an `@Injectable` and listing it as a
constructor argument on the `ArnyQuotesHandler`.

```typescript
@Injectable()
class ArnyService {
  public getQuote(): string {
    const quotes = [
      "Hasta la vista, baby!",
      "If it bleeds, we can kill it.",
      "Come with me if you want to live.",
    ];

    return getRandomItem(quotes);
  }
}
```

## Injectable objects

You may come across use cases where manually registering objects or classes in the DI is
required. In this scenario you can access the DI container via the Bigsby instance and call the `register`
method. An `InjectableItem` is returned including a unique token that can be used to reference the
injectable in the future.

```typescript
const di = bigsby.getInjectionContainer();

const config: Config = {
  printResponse: true,
};

const { token: configToken } = di.register(config).successOrThrow();
```

:::warning

Make sure all of your injectable registrations are completed _before_ calling `createApiHandler`,
otherwise they may not be available to your handler functions.

## Types of injection

The above example is a specific type of constructor injection that doesn't rely on any decorators.
In addition to this type of injection, you can use the `@Autowire` decorator to perform different
injection types.

### ðŸŒ¾ Field injection

If we preferred, the `ArnyService` class could instead be injected into the `ArnyQuotesHandler` class,
using field injection. The config object we manually injected can also be injected using its injection
token.

```typescript
@Api()
class ArnyQuotesHandler implements ApiHandler {
  @Autowire(ArnyService)
  private readonly service!: ArnyService;

  @Autowire(configToken)
  private readonly config!: Config;

  constructor() {
    // I don't have access to my injectables here
  }

  public async invoke(): Promise<string> {
    const response = this.service.getQuote();

    if (this.config.printResponse) {
      console.log(response);
    }

    return response;
  }
}
```

### ðŸ”¨ Constructor injection

The same can be achieved via constructor injection, which is the only injection type which
allows access to the injectables inside the class constructor.

```typescript
@Api()
class ArnyQuotesHandler implements ApiHandler {
  constructor(
    @Autowire(configToken)
    private readonly config: Config,
    @Autowire(ArnyService) // <- Not mandatory (see below)
    private readonly service: ArnyService
  ) {
    // I have access to my injectables here
  }

  public async invoke(): Promise<string> {
    const response = this.service.getQuote();

    if (this.config.printResponse) {
      console.log(response);
    }

    return response;
  }
}
```

:::tip

The `@Autowire` decorator isn't strictly required for classes that have been registered with
the `@Injectable` decorator. The injection framework is smart enough to infer what should be injected by
adding the class as a parameter (as seen in the [first example](#injectable)).

:::

## Environment Variables

You can inject environment variables into class members using the `@Env` annotation.

```typescript
process.env.MY_STR = "test";

@Api()
class ArnyQuotesHandler implements ApiHandler {
  @Env("MY_STR")
  private myString: string;

  constructor() {
    console.log(this.myString);
    // "test"
  }
}
```
