# Getting started

This getting started guide will show you all you need to know in order to create a simple
API Gateway triggered AWS Lambda function using the Bigsby library.

### Pre-requisites

If you haven't already, please complete the steps in [setup](../setup).

## Step 1: Create a Bigsby instance

The main purpose of the Bigsby instance is to act as a factory for handler functions.
It contains configuration that will be applied to each handler created by the instance,
and its own isolated and unique dependency
[injection container](https://burketyler.github.io/ts-injection/usage#creating-an-injection-container).

Defining an instance is as simple as creating a new Bigsby class. If your app consists of
functions that require vastly different configuration, e.g. public vs private APIs, you can
create as many Bigsby instances as required to cover each grouping of functions.

```typescript
const bigsby = new Bigsby();
```

It's common that you will need to add configuration applicable to each handler in your
application, this can be defined as a constructor argument to the instance, or at any point
after initialization. See [configuration](/usage/configuration) for more information.

```typescript
const bigsby = new Bigsby({
  api: {
    request: {
      auth: authenticateRequest,
    },
    response: {
      headers: {
        "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
      },
    },
  },
});
```

## Step 2: Define a handler class

An `ApiHandler` is used to handle events triggered via API Gateway v1 (rest) or v2 (http).
The `@Api` decorator indicates to Bigsby that this class should be treated as an ApiHandler.
The class must implement the ApiHandler interface.

```typescript
@Api()
class ArnyQuotesHandler implements ApiHandler {
  @Autowire(ArnyService)
  private service!: ArnyService;

  public async invoke(@Body() request: GetQuoteRequest): Promise<string> {
    return this.service.getQuote(request.movie);
  }
}
```

The above handler is injecting a service dependency via the `Autowire` decorator
and parsing a request object from the event payload using the `Body` decorator. You can learn
more about [dependency injection](/usage/dependency-injection) and [event parsing](/usage/event-parsing)
in their respective sections.

## Step 3: Create handler function

Using Bigsby, create and export your handler function by specifying the handler class.
The function will automatically inherit configuration specified at the instance level.
You can also define configuration that should be scoped to this handler only.

```typescript
export default bigsby.createApiHandler(ArnyQuotesHandler, {
  lifecycle: {
    onError: [sendAlert],
  },
});
```

Export the handler function, reference it in your lambda build chain, and you're ready to rock and roll 🍾

The function returned by `createApiHandler` is the `invoke` method of the specified handler class,
wrapped with all the bells and whistles of the Bigsby library including:

- 💉 dependency injection
- 🔎 parsing
- 👮 validation
- 🔢 versioning
- 🔐 authentication
- 🪝 lifecycle
